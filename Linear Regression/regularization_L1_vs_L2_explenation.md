    "### In this case, where the model is overfitting and performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, and the predictions are highly sensitive to small changes in the input data, it's best to use the **Ridge regularization technique (L2)**.\n",
    "### That's because the Ridge technique is used to reduce the model's sensitivity to noise. Ridge regularization adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients, thus helping the model generalize better to new data and discouraging it from fitting it too closely."
